# breast-cancer-diagnosis-a1
Assignment 1 ISYS 620 (Data Analytics with Artificial Intelligence)

Goal: predict whether or not a patient has a positive breast cancer diagnosis based on tumor characteristics

In this assignment, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), applied mean imputation for missing values, built a classification model (logistic regression), and interpreted the results using sklearn's classification report and confusion matrix.

The multicollinearity.ipynb file uses the same dataset, however, I computed the variance inflation factor (VIF) to locate and drop the highly correlated variables. I re-ran the logistic regression model and compared the performance of both logistic regression models.
